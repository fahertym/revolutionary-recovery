Vision: Transform our current profit-driven economy into one that maximizes social well-being ("social profit"), environmental sustainability, and equitable resource distribution. Align incentives so that the benefits to individuals, businesses, governments and the environment are all in harmony.
Key Components:
1. Social Profit: Develop comprehensive metrics to measure citizen happiness, quality of life, social cohesion, health, education etc. Use algorithms to calculate an overall "social profit" score reflecting collective well-being.        
2. Resource Allocation: Use AI to dynamically and efficiently allocate resources (labor, materials, infrastructure) based on real-time data and needs. Implement secure         blockchain-based systems for tracking.         
3. Environmental Integration: Make environmental impact and sustainability core components of the "social profit" metrics. Use predictive modeling to ensure         economic activities stay within ecological limits. Tokenize         environmental costs.         
4. Participatory Governance: Empower citizens to give real-time feedback on quality of life. Decentralize some decision-making to communities to address local needs. Make         data transparent.         
5. Cooperative Economics: Promote business models like cooperatives and social enterprises where workers, consumers and communities have a direct stake. Democratize economic power.         
6. Green Innovation: Heavily incentivize R&D into clean technologies and sustainable         practices. Make "green" the most profitable approach for         businesses.         
7. Global Collaboration: Establish international standards for measuring social and environmental health. Collaborate on managing shared resources equitably. Address         global inequalities.         
8. Redefine Progress: Move beyond GDP to include metrics of sustainability, happiness and social health as true measures of economic success. Educate the public on this new paradigm.         
Implementation Roadmap:
* Conduct local pilot projects to test and refine the model         
* Roll out enabling technologies like AI resource management systems         
* Implement policy and regulatory changes in phases         
* Run public awareness campaigns to        build understanding and support         
* Transition businesses with         incentives and support         
* Collaborate internationally to         align efforts         
* Continuously adapt and improve based on data and feedback         
This reimagined economic system utilizes cutting-edge technologies and cooperative models to create a world where all boats rise together - where economic activities, by design, increase societal well-being and operate in harmony with the environment. It's a radically different way of defining and pursuing shared prosperity that counts what really matters.

Vision Statement: Our aim is to fundamentally transform the current economic paradigm from one driven by financial profit to one that seeks to maximize social well-being, environmental health, and equitable prosperity for all. We envision a system where the interests of individuals, businesses, governments, and the environment are aligned, where economic activities enhance quality of life and operate within ecological boundaries, and where innovation is harnessed for the common good. By redefining how we measure and pursue economic success, we can create a world of shared abundance and resilience.
1. Social Profit Metrics and Measurement 1.1 Defining Social Profit Social Profit is a comprehensive measure of a society's overall well-being and prosperity. It encompasses a wide range of indicators reflecting the quality of life, social health, and happiness of the population. Unlike traditional economic metrics like GDP, Social Profit considers factors such as:
* Physical and mental health
* Education and lifelong learning
* +
* Employment satisfaction and fulfillment
* Social connection and community vitality
* Environmental quality and access to nature
* Personal safety and security
* Work-life balance and leisure time
* Political freedom and democratic engagement
* Material sufficiency and equitable distribution of wealth
1.2 Metrics Development Process A multi-stakeholder committee consisting of experts from various fields (economics, sociology, psychology, environmental science etc.), along with representatives from government, business, and civil society, will be tasked with developing the specific metrics and methodologies for measuring Social Profit. The committee will: a) Identify key domains and sub-domains to be included in the Social Profit measurement. b) Develop specific indicators and data sources for each domain, drawing on existing research and best practices where possible. c) Determine appropriate weightings and aggregation methods for combining indicators into overall Social Profit scores. d) Establish data collection and reporting protocols, balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency and privacy concerns. e) Set targets and benchmarks for Social Profit performance over time.
1.3 Algorithmic Calculation and Reporting Advanced algorithms, potentially leveraging machine learning techniques, will be employed to calculate Social Profit scores from the multitude of data inputs. The algorithms will be designed to:
* Handle data of varying types and quality, filling gaps through inference where necessary.
* Adapt weightings and calculations based on the latest research and understanding.
* Provide breakdowns and analyses of Social Profit at various levels (individual, community, regional, national).
* Generate user-friendly visualizations and interactive reporting tools for different audiences.
A dedicated, independent agency will be established to oversee the collection, processing and dissemination of Social Profit data. This agency will be charged with ensuring the integrity, transparency, and continuous improvement of the measurement system.
1.4 Integration into Decision-Making Social Profit metrics will become the central compass for decision-making at all levels of society.
For Governments:
* Policy options will be evaluated based on their expected impact on Social Profit.
* Budgets will be allocated to maximize improvements in Social Profit.
* Performance of government bodies and officials will be assessed against Social Profit outcomes in their jurisdictions.
For Businesses:
* Social Profit impact will become a key performance indicator alongside financial metrics.
* Investment and project decisions will be made with consideration to Social Profit return.
* Reporting on Social Profit contributions will be mandatory and public.
For Individuals:
* Personal decisions around lifestyles, careers, consumption, and civic participation will be informed by their anticipated effects on personal and collective Social Profit.
* Social Profit metrics will help individuals understand their own well-being and identify areas for improvement.
Over time, as the system matures, it is expected that a cultural shift will occur where the pursuit of Social Profit becomes the central organizing principle of economic and social life.
2. AI-Optimized Resource Allocation 2.1 The Resource Allocation Challenge One of the key functions of an economy is to allocate finite resources - human labor, skills, raw materials, land, energy, etc. - towards the production of goods and services that meet human needs and desires. Conventional market economies do this through the interplay of supply and demand, with prices acting as the main signal driving resource flows. However, this often leads to outcomes that are suboptimal from a societal well-being perspective - resources get directed to producing things that do not significantly improve quality of life, negative externalities are ignored, and public goods are undersupplied.
The Social Profit economy aims to allocate resources in a way that directly optimizes for societal well-being, taking a holistic view that considers all positive and negative impacts.
2.2 AI System for Resource Optimization At the heart of the new resource allocation system will be an advanced AI that acts as a global optimizer. The AI will:
* Receive real-time data on resource availabilities, production capacities, consumption patterns, and Social Profit metric performances.
* Model the complex web of interrelationships between resource inputs, production processes, consumption outcomes, and Social Profit impacts.
* Calculate optimal resource allocations that maximize Social Profit within given constraints.
* Provide actionable recommendations to economic actors (producers, consumers, policymakers) on how to adjust their activities.
* Continuously learn and adapt based on actual outcomes to improve its predictive and prescriptive capabilities over time.
Key components of the AI system include: a) Data Aggregation and Processing
* Interfaces for securely collecting and harmonizing data from diverse public and private sources
* Protocols for ensuring data quality, reliability, and representativeness
* Methods for filling data gaps and reconciling inconsistencies
b) Simulation and Optimization Engines
* Detailed models of economic activities and their social-environmental impacts
* Algorithms for exploring the solution space and identifying optimal resource allocations
* Techniques for efficiently handling the scale and complexity of a whole-economy optimization problem
c) Recommendation Modules
* Tools for translating optimization outputs into understandable and actionable recommendations for different actors
* Customizable interfaces for delivering recommendations via various channels (apps, dashboards, reports, etc.)
* Explanation capabilities to provide transparency on how recommendations were arrived at
d) Learning and Adaptation Mechanisms
* Continuous monitoring of actual versus predicted outcomes
* Feedback loops for adjusting models based on real-world data
* Ongoing research and development to incorporate latest techniques and understandings
, working in close partnership with governments, businesses, academia, and civil society. Utmost priority will be given to ensuring the AI remains transparent, accountable, and aligned with human values.
2.3 Interfaces and Integration For the AI's resource allocation optimizations to translate into real-world impact, seamless integration with existing economic systems and actor interfaces is critical.
On the production side, the AI system will connect with the operational management systems of manufacturers, agriculture, energy suppliers, transportation providers, and other producers. It will provide them with granular recommendations on input sourcing, process improvements, product mix optimization etc. to align production with Social Profit outcomes.
On the consumption side, the AI will inform consumer-facing applications that help individuals make purchasing and usage decisions that improve their personal and collective well-being. This could range from personalized product recommendations to community-level resource sharing platforms.
For policymakers, the AI will provide macro-level analysis and simulation tools to explore the Social Profit implications of different policy choices. It will also enable detailed, real-time monitoring of policy implementation and impact.
Across all domains, the aim is to have economic actors internalize Social Profit considerations into their regular decision flows, guided by the AI system's intelligence. Over time, as the AI proves its effectiveness, more and more decision-making can be delegated to it, moving towards increasingly automated resource optimization.
To support the rollout and adoption of this system, comprehensive education and training programs will be put in place for workers, managers, policymakers, and the general public. The goal is to give everyone the skills and understanding needed to effectively interact with the AI and interpret its recommendations.
2.4 Decentralization and Security While the resource allocation AI provides centralized intelligence, actual implementation will be decentralized to the level of individual economic actors. This avoids concentration of power and single points of failure.
All data flows and AI recommendations will be securely logged on distributed, encrypted ledgers (blockchains) to maintain an immutable record. Multi-stakeholder oversight and auditing processes will be put in place to prevent tampering or misuse.
The underlying algorithms and models of the AI will be open source and subject to continuous peer review to identify and correct any biases or errors. A dedicated global network of AI safety researchers will work to anticipate and mitigate any risks associated with a system of this scale and impact.
Contingency plans and manual override protocols will be established to deal with any system outages or unexpected behaviors. Regular drills will be conducted to maintain readiness.
Through these measures, the aim is to create an AI resource allocation system that is highly robust, transparent and trustworthy, able to earn the confidence of all members of society as it guides our economy towards greater social and environmental well-being.
3. Environmental Integration and Sustainability 3.1 Environmental Metrics in Social Profit A key limitation of traditional economic metrics is the failure to properly account for environmental impacts and dependencies. The Social Profit framework corrects this by fully integrating environmental considerations.
The Metrics Development Committee (1.2) will include environmental scientists and ecological economists tasked with identifying the most relevant and robust indicators of environmental health and sustainability, such as:
* Greenhouse gas emissions and climate change contribution
* Air and water pollution levels
* Soil health and erosion rates
* Biodiversity loss and ecosystem integrity
* Renewable resource stocks and depletion rates
* Waste generation and recycling rates
These metrics will be incorporated into the overall Social Profit score calculation, with weightings based on scientific understanding of planetary boundaries and thresholds.
In addition to aggregate national-level tracking, the system will also provide breakdowns of environmental performance by sector, region, and even individual entities (businesses, households etc.). This granularity enables targeted interventions.
3.2 Environmental Impact Tokenization To drive behavior change at the micro level, a system of Environmental Impact Tokens (EITs) will be introduced. These are digital tokens representing the right to generate a certain amount of environmental impact, whether positive (e.g. carbon sequestration) or negative (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions).
The total supply of EITs will be set based on scientifically-determined sustainable levels for each type of impact. These will then be allocated to economic actors (businesses, individuals etc.) based on factors such as historical responsibility, current needs, and capacity for change.
All activities with significant environmental footprints will require the spending of corresponding EITs. Actors can earn EITs through positive environmental contributions. EITs will be tradable on regulated exchanges, enabling the emergence of market-based prices for different environmental impacts.
Over time, the total supply of negative impact EITs will be gradually reduced, driving an economywide shift towards sustainability. Positive impact EITs will become an increasingly valuable asset.
The EIT system will be underpinned by a comprehensive environmental monitoring and accounting infrastructure. This will leverage IoT sensors, satellite imagery, blockchain-based reporting and verification, and AI analysis to track environmental performance with high accuracy and reliability.
3.3 Environmental AI Advisor Building on the general resource allocation AI (2.2), a dedicated Environmental AI Advisor will be developed. This AI system will specialize in analyzing environmental data, predicting impacts, and recommending actions for sustainability.
Some key functions will include:
* Monitoring environmental performance against targets at macro and micro scales
* Predicting future environmental states under different scenarios
* Identifying the most effective interventions to improve environmental outcomes
* Optimizing resource allocation and economic activities for sustainability
* Providing personalized recommendations to individuals and organizations on reducing their footprints
The Environmental AI Advisor will interface with the core economic AI to ensure that all resource allocation decisions are made with sustainability in mind. It will also connect with various actor interfaces (government policy systems, business operation software, consumer apps etc.) to drive environmentally-informed decisions at all levels.
Access to the Environmental AI's insights and recommendations will be openly available to all, supporting public awareness and engagement around sustainability challenges and solutions.
3.4 Green Innovation Incentives Achieving a truly sustainable economy will require continuous waves of green innovation. The Social Profit system will strongly incentivize R&D and entrepreneurship aimed at developing cleaner technologies and more circular production models.
Some key policies and programs will include:
* Preferential allocation of research funding and facilities to sustainability-focused projects
* Streamlined regulatory approvals and IP protections for green innovations
* Tax breaks and subsidies for businesses adopting cleaner technologies and practices
* Government procurement prioritizing sustainable products and services
* Dedicated support for green tech commercialization and scale-up
This will be complemented by a comprehensive green skills education and training program to develop the workforce needed for a sustainable economy. Schools and universities will be encouraged to integrate sustainability across the curriculum.
A national green innovation dashboard will track key indicators such as green patent filings, clean tech investments, and sustainable business formation rates. Regular progress reports and celebrations of success stories will help build cultural momentum around green innovation.
Over time, the combination of EIT pricing pressures and green innovation incentives should make sustainable practices the most economically attractive option by far, driving a self-reinforcing cycle of environmental improvement.
3.5 International Environmental Agreements Recognizing that environmental challenges do not respect national borders, the Social Profit system will place a high priority on international cooperation for sustainability.
The system's environmental metrics and accounting infrastructure will be developed in alignment with global standards, enabling cross-border comparability and collaboration.
The government will actively participate in and help strengthen international environmental agreements, from the Paris Climate Accords to the Convention on Biological Diversity. It will advocate for all countries to adopt Social Profit-style frameworks with harmonized environmental components.
Overseas aid and investment programs will be reoriented to support sustainability initiatives in developing countries. Trade agreements will include strong environmental chapters committing parties to upholding high standards.
A special focus will be on ensuring globally fair and equitable allocation of the remaining carbon budget and other planetary boundaries. The government will support the establishment of a Global Environmental Impact Exchange to enable countries to trade EITs across borders.
Diplomatically, the government will make sustainability cooperation a top priority, using all levers to encourage laggard countries to raise their ambitions. It will also work to strengthen global environmental governance institutions and develop new ones where needed, such as an International Court for the Environment.
By taking this proactive international stance, the aim is to catalyze a global race to the top on sustainability, with countries competing to be the cleanest and greenest as measured by the Social Profit metrics. Over time, this should drive a worldwide economic transformation towards true harmony with the planet's ecological limits.
4. Participatory Governance and Decentralized Decision-Making 4.1 Real-Time Citizen Feedback Mechanisms A key feature of the Social Profit system is the continuous inclusion of citizen voices in governance. This will be enabled by a suite of digital platforms and tools for real-time, mass-scale citizen engagement.
At the simplest level, all citizens will have access to user-friendly apps and websites where they can provide feedback on their quality of life, satisfaction with public services, and ideas for improvement. This data will feed directly into the Social Profit metrics calculations (1.3), ensuring that the system stays responsive to people's lived experiences.
More in-depth engagement opportunities will also be available, such as:
* Online deliberation forums where citizens can discuss policy issues and trade-offs
* Participatory budgeting platforms where citizens can allocate portions of public funds
* Citizen science projects where the public helps collect and analyze data for decision-making
* Citizen juries and assemblies where representative groups deliberate on complex challenges
Cutting-edge collective intelligence and sentiment analysis techniques will be employed to process the large volumes of citizen input and derive meaningful insights for action. Regular reports will be published showcasing how citizen feedback has shaped policies and outcomes.
Public officials will be expected to engage with these citizen feedback mechanisms as part of their duties. Performance evaluations and career progression will consider responsiveness to citizen input.
Over time, the aim is to cultivate a culture of active citizenship, where individuals feel empowered to continually shape the policies and services that affect their lives.
4.2 Decentralized and Delegated Decision-Making The Social Profit system recognizes that many decisions are best made at the local level, by those closest to the impacts. As such, a key principle will be the decentralization and delegation of decision-making authority.
In general, decisions will be pushed to the lowest level of governance compatible with the scale of the issue. Subsidiarity will be the default.
For example:
* Neighborhood-level issues like community center programming or park maintenance will be decided by neighborhood councils.
* City-level issues like zoning or transit planning will be decided by city governments.
* Regional issues like ecosystem management or transportation networks will be decided by regional bodies.
* Only truly national-scale issues like monetary policy or foreign affairs will be handled centrally.
Even within these levels, decision-making will be further delegated to the most relevant stakeholders. For example, decisions about school curriculums will heavily involve teachers and parents. Decisions about industrial policy will heavily involve workers and businesses.
Digital platforms will be developed to facilitate this decentralized decision-making, including:
* Secure voting and consensus tools for group decision-making
* Reputation and credential systems for selecting delegated decision-makers
* Knowledge-sharing forums for exchanging best practices across contexts
* Blockchain-based record-keeping for transparency and accountability
Capacity-building programs will be put in place to ensure that all communities and stakeholder groups have the skills and resources needed to effectively take on decision-making roles.
The role of the central government will shift towards setting overall frameworks and standards, providing support and resources, and intervening only where necessary to address inequities or resolve disputes.
The aim is to create an agile and adaptive governance system, where decisions are made quickly and responsively by those with the most relevant knowledge and stakes, guided by the overarching Social Profit metrics and AI insights.

4.3 Transparency and Accountability Measures The radical decentralization and delegation of decision-making in the Social Profit system requires robust transparency and accountability measures to maintain legitimacy and effectiveness.
At the core will be the principle of "open by default" - all data, algorithms, decisions, and outcomes will be publicly available unless there is a compelling privacy or security reason. This will apply across all levels of governance, from neighborhood councils to national ministries.
Some key components will include:
* Easy-to-use online portals where citizens can access real-time information on policies, budgets, projects, and performance metrics relevant to their communities and interests.
* Mandatory reporting requirements for all public officials and decision-making bodies, covering topics such as meeting minutes, voting records, conflict of interest declarations, and expenditure justifications.
* Open application programming interfaces (APIs) allowing third-party researchers, journalists, and watchdogs to analyze raw governance data and build monitoring tools.
* Blockchain-based record-keeping to create immutable audit trails of all decisions and actions.
* Whistleblower protection laws and secure reporting channels to encourage exposure of misconduct.
Accountability will be enforced through a combination of:
* Legal penalties for violating transparency and ethics rules, enforced by an independent anti-corruption agency.
* Reputation systems that publicly score and compare the performance of decision-makers and governance bodies.
* Recall mechanisms allowing citizens to remove officials who lose public confidence.
* Ombudsman offices providing impartial investigation and redress of citizen complaints.
* Regular audits by independent third parties to assess compliance and efficacy.
Alongside these formal controls, a culture of active transparency and voluntary disclosure will be fostered. Public officials will be expected to proactively communicate their work to citizens, going beyond minimum requirements. Governance bodies will run public outreach campaigns to solicit citizen scrutiny. Civic education programs will equip the public with the skills to engage in monitoring.
The aim is to create an unprecedented level of openness and answerability in governance, ensuring that the decentralized power is not abused and that public decisions remain aligned with the Social Profit priorities of the populace. While no system is immune to failure, the combination of strong transparency, robust accountability, and empowered public oversight offers the best chance of catching and correcting problems before they escalate.
4.4 Adaptive Policy Experimentation The complexity and dynamism of modern society means that even the most well-informed policies are inherently uncertain - there is always a chance they will fail to achieve intended outcomes or produce unintended consequences. The Social Profit system embraces this uncertainty through an ethos of adaptive policy experimentation.
Rather than attempting to design perfect policies from the outset, the approach will be to treat policies as hypotheses to be tested and refined in practice. New policies will be rolled out incrementally, starting with small-scale pilots, and closely monitored for their impacts. Based on the feedback, policies will be iteratively adjusted, expanded, or discarded.
Some key features of this approach include:
* Formal experimentation protocols: All new policies will be launched as formal experiments, with clear metrics for success, data collection plans, and sunset clauses if they fail to achieve intended outcomes.
* Randomized controlled trials: Where feasible, policies will be evaluated through randomized trials, comparing outcomes between treatment and control groups to rigorously test effectiveness.
* A/B testing: Different policy variations will be trialed simultaneously and compared head-to-head to optimize design choices.
* Adaptive algorithms: Policies will be encoded into adaptive algorithms that automatically adjust parameters based on real-time performance data.
* Prediction markets: Prediction markets will be used to surface collective intelligence on the likely outcomes of proposed policies.
* Citizen feedback loops: Citizen experiences with and attitudes towards new policies will be continuously monitored through digital feedback mechanisms and incorporated into iteration cycles.
Concurrent with these experimentation processes, there will be mechanisms to rapidly scale up successful policies and phase out failures:
* Agile budgeting: Financial resources will be dynamically reallocated from underperforming initiatives to promising ones, ensuring that successful policies are not constrained by static budget cycles.
* Modular design: Policies will be designed as modular components that can be easily recombined and repurposed across contexts, enabling the rapid diffusion of proven approaches.
* Policy codebases: All policy code (legal language, algorithms, etc.) will be stored in public version-controlled repositories, allowing for rapid iteration and forking by different jurisdictions.
* Policy clearinghouses: Central knowledge hubs will be maintained where policymakers can browse and compare the performance of policies from around the world to inform their own experiments.
Underlying this approach will be a culture of humility and continuous learning. Policymakers will be expected to openly acknowledge the limits of their knowledge, actively seek feedback and criticism, and be ready to change course based on evidence. Citizens will be engaged as co-experimenters, providing on-the-ground insights to complement formal data analysis.
The aim is to create a governance system that is highly agile and adaptive, able to rapidly try out novel solutions, discard failures, and scale up successes. Over time, this evolutionary approach should result in a policy landscape that is continuously optimizing for Social Profit outcomes, even as the underlying socio-technical conditions change.
While there are certainly risks of instability and waste in such an experimental approach, these are outweighed by the risks of sticking with static, maladaptive policies in a world of accelerating change. With appropriate safeguards and democratic oversight, policy experimentation offers the best path to a truly responsive and effective governance system.
5. Cooperative Economics and Shared Prosperity 5.1 Cooperative Business Models At the heart of the Social Profit economic system will be a new generation of cooperative business models that prioritize shared benefit over private gain.
The key feature of these models will be the inclusion of all stakeholders - workers, customers, suppliers, communities, and the environment - as co-owners and co-decision-makers in the business. This ensures that everyone who contributes to and is impacted by the business has a voice in its governance and a stake in its success.
Some common cooperative structures that will be promoted include:
* Worker cooperatives: Businesses owned and democratically controlled by their workers.
* Consumer cooperatives: Businesses owned by their customers, such as food or housing co-ops.
* Producer cooperatives: Businesses jointly owned by independent producers, common in agriculture and crafts.
* Platform cooperatives: Online platforms owned and governed by the users who depend on them.
* Community businesses: Enterprises owned by and serving the needs of specific local communities.
* Steward ownership: Businesses with self-perpetuating ownership structures that lock in social mission and prohibit extractive profits.
Government policies will strongly incentivize the formation and growth of these cooperative models through measures such as:
* Favorable tax treatment for cooperatives, including exemptions from corporate income taxes.
* Preferential access to government contracts, subsidies, and development support.
* Mandatory asset locks and profit reinvestment requirements to prevent demutualization.
* Succession rights and assistance for converting conventional businesses into cooperatives.
Alongside these supportive policies, a robust ecosystem of cooperative development support will be fostered, including:
* Education and training programs on cooperative management and governance.
* Specialist financial institutions providing patient capital and growth financing for co-ops.
* Technical assistance providers offering legal, accounting, and strategic planning services.
* Incubators and accelerators nurturing new cooperative startups.
* Research centers studying and innovating cooperative models across sectors.
Over time, the aim is to make cooperatives the default organizational form in the economy, with conventional shareholder-centric corporations becoming the exception. This will create an economy where the benefits of business activity are much more widely shared, and where economic power is much more democratically distributed.
5.2 Social Wealth Funds and Common Assets Alongside cooperative businesses, the Social Profit economy will also feature a significant expansion of common and collective forms of ownership.
The centerpiece of this will be the creation of Social Wealth Funds - publicly owned investment vehicles that acquire and manage assets on behalf of the entire population. These funds will be capitalized through a variety of sources, such as:
* The transfer of existing public assets like land, natural resources, and infrastructure.
* Levies on private wealth, such as inheritance taxes and progressive capital taxes.
* The issuance of new money by the central bank, allocated directly to the funds.
* Returns generated by the funds' own investment activities.
The assets held by the Social Wealth Funds will be considered the common property of all citizens, with each person granted an equal, inalienable share. The funds will be governed democratically, with citizens electing representatives to set investment strategies and manage the assets.
The primary mandate of the Social Wealth Funds will be to maximize long-term Social Profit returns. This means investing in projects and enterprises that generate the greatest social and environmental benefits, such as:
* Affordable housing and community land trusts
* Clean energy and green infrastructure
* Public health and education facilities
* Worker-owned cooperatives and social enterprises
* Research and development in socially beneficial technologies
In addition to financing these types of projects, the Social Wealth Funds will also use their shareholdings to actively shape corporate behavior. As major equity owners, the funds will have significant influence over business decisions and will use this power to steer companies towards greater social responsibility and alignment with Social Profit metrics.
Over time, as the Social Wealth Funds grow to represent an increasing share of total economic assets, they will provide a powerful counterweight to private capital and help to reorient the entire economy towards the common good.
To complement the Social Wealth Funds, the Social Profit system will also encourage the expansion of other forms of common ownership, such as:
* Open digital infrastructure: Crucial digital systems and data will be treated as public goods and placed under democratic stewardship to prevent private capture and rent-seeking.
* Knowledge commons: The results of publicly funded research and creative work will be made freely available to all under open licenses, rather than enclosed by intellectual property monopolies.
* Urban commons: Spaces and resources in cities will be increasingly managed as civic commons, with residents gaining greater collective control over their urban environments.
* Bioregional commons: Ecosystems and natural resources will be brought under the shared stewardship of local communities who depend on them, ensuring sustainable and equitable management.
The growth of these common assets will be supported by legal and institutional reforms, such as:
* The recognition of new types of common property rights that supersede individual private ownership.
* The creation of new participatory governance frameworks, such as community land parliaments and open-source voting systems.
* The development of new collective financing mechanisms, such as crowdfunding platforms and complementary currencies.
* The establishment of new public trusts and stewardship bodies to manage common assets on behalf of their beneficiaries.
The ultimate aim is to create an economy in which private property, while still important, is balanced by a rich variety of cooperative and common ownership forms. This more pluralistic approach to ownership will help to diffuse economic power, ensure that everyone has a stake in shared prosperity, and align economic activity with Social Profit principles.
5.3 Universal Basic Assets A key feature of the cooperative economy will be the provision of Universal Basic Assets (UBA) to every member of society. This is the idea that, in addition to traditional income supports, each person should have guaranteed access to the fundamental resources needed to participate fully in social and economic life.
The core suite of UBAs will include:
* Housing: Access to secure, affordable, and quality housing, whether through social housing programs, community land trusts, or housing cooperatives.
* Healthcare: Comprehensive public health services and insurance, ensuring that everyone can maintain good health regardless of employment status or income.
* Education and training: Lifelong access to free public education, from early childhood through higher education and vocational training.
* Information and communication: Access to reliable high-speed internet, computing devices, and digital literacy training, ensuring that no one is excluded from the digital economy.
* Transportation: Extensive public transportation networks complemented by shared mobility services, providing affordable and sustainable mobility options for all.
* Civic infrastructure: Well-maintained and accessible public spaces, libraries, recreational facilities, and cultural institutions that enrich community life.
Beyond this core set, the UBA framework will also progressively extend to include other key resources such as childcare, legal services, energy, and basic financial tools.
The provision of UBAs will be the shared responsibility of various levels of government, cooperatives, and social institutions. Funding will come from a combination of sources, including:
* Progressive taxation, with higher rates on top incomes and wealth to redistribute resources.
* Public ownership of key assets, with revenues channeled into UBA programs.
* Social wealth funds, with a portion of returns earmarked for UBA initiatives.
* Cooperative surpluses, with a share of profits from cooperative enterprises dedicated to supporting member UBAs.
The administration of UBAs will be highly decentralized and participatory, with decisions about the design and delivery of programs made by the communities and individuals who use them. This could involve models such as:
* Participatory budgeting, where residents directly allocate resources to different UBA projects.
* Community land trusts and housing cooperatives, where members collectively manage their own housing.
* Open-access educational resources and peer-to-peer learning networks, where knowledge is freely shared.
* Cooperative platforms for mobility and digital services, owned and governed by their users.
To ensure equitable access and quality standards across communities, there will also be higher-level coordination and support from regional and national governments. This will include setting common frameworks, redistributing resources to poorer areas, and providing technical assistance.
In addition to ensuring a baseline level of economic security and opportunity for all, the UBA system will also have several broader economic benefits:
* Boosting consumer demand by putting resources in the hands of those most likely to spend them.
* Enhancing productivity by investing in human capital and enabling people to take risks and start new ventures.
* Reducing inequality by giving everyone a stake in the productive assets of society.
* Improving social cohesion and political stability by ensuring that everyone feels included and invested in the system.
Over time, as the UBA system matures and expands, it has the potential to evolve into a form of Universal Basic Ownership - a situation in which every individual has a birthright claim to a share of society's productive resources. This could take the form of a universal capital endowment granted to each person upon reaching adulthood, a regular dividend paid out from common asset returns, or a combination of both.
Such a system would represent a profound shift towards a more equitable and inclusive form of economic organization - one in which the benefits of productivity and growth are widely shared, and in which everyone has the means to participate as full and equal members of society. By making the economy work for everyone, Universal Basic Assets will be a cornerstone of the cooperative and Social Profit-driven future.
5.4 Social Profit Accounting and Corporate Governance To fully align business activity with the creation of Social Profit, there will need to be fundamental changes to corporate accounting, reporting, and governance practices.
At the heart of this transformation will be the development of a new Social Profit Accounting (SPA) framework. This framework will expand the scope of what businesses measure and report beyond just financial metrics to include a comprehensive assessment of their social and environmental impacts.
Some key elements of SPA will include:
* Integrated reporting: Companies will be required to publish integrated reports that provide a holistic view of their financial, social, and environmental performance. This will involve reporting on a wide range of metrics related to factors such as job quality, community impact, carbon emissions, resource usage, and supply chain practices.
* Valuation of externalities: Businesses will be required to quantify and report on the positive and negative externalities they generate, using standardized methodologies for valuing impacts such as health outcomes, ecosystem services, and social capital creation. Over time, these externalities will be increasingly incorporated into pricing and financial decision-making.
* Stakeholder accounts: In addition to traditional shareholder financial statements, companies will also prepare separate "stakeholder accounts" detailing their impacts on and obligations to different stakeholder groups such as workers, customers, suppliers, and local communities. These accounts will be audited and publicly disclosed.
To ensure the integrity and comparability of SPA reporting, there will be ongoing processes to develop and refine shared standards and methodologies. This will involve collaboration between businesses, accounting professionals, academic experts, and stakeholder representatives. The resulting standards will be continuously updated to reflect evolving best practices and scientific understanding.
The adoption of SPA will be supported by changes to securities laws and stock exchange listing requirements that mandate comprehensive social and environmental disclosures. Auditing processes will be strengthened to verify the accuracy of SPA reporting, with severe penalties for misrepresentation.
In addition to transformation of accounting practices, the Social Profit system will also involve profound changes to corporate governance to give stakeholders a much greater voice in decision-making.
Some key reforms will include:
* Stakeholder board representation: Corporate boards will be required to include representatives of key stakeholder groups such as workers, consumers, and local communities. These representatives will be democratically elected by their respective constituencies and have the same fiduciary duties and voting rights as other directors.
* Social Profit primacy: The fiduciary duty of directors and executives will be redefined to prioritize the creation of Social Profit over the narrow pursuit of shareholder returns. This will give leaders the legal mandate and protection to make decisions that balance the interests of all stakeholders.
* Mission-locking: Corporations will be able to adopt legal forms and charter provisions that lock in their social mission and prevent future drift or dilution. This could involve structures such as stakeholder-governed nonprofit corporations, benefit corporations with expanded fiduciary duties, or trust-based ownership models.
* Participatory management: Companies will be encouraged to adopt more participatory and decentralized management practices that give workers and other stakeholders greater autonomy and influence over decisions that affect them. This could range from works councils and co-determination arrangements to fully self-managed teams and holocratic structures.
To drive the adoption of these governance reforms, several policy levers will be used:
* Tax incentives and procurement preferences for companies that adopt stakeholder governance and mission-locking provisions.
* Antitrust reforms that consider stakeholder impacts and social mission as factors in merger and monopoly regulation.
* Corporate
5.4 Social Profit Accounting and Corporate Governance (continued)
Corporate charter requirements that make stakeholder governance and Social Profit primacy the default for new businesses. Investor pressure and advocacy to push existing companies to voluntarily adopt governance reforms.
Over time, the combination of Social Profit accounting and stakeholder governance has the potential to fundamentally reorient the purpose and functioning of the corporate sector. Rather than serving as engines of shareholder value extraction, businesses will become vehicles for creating shared and sustainable prosperity.
This transformation will not happen overnight, and there will undoubtedly be resistance from those who benefit from the current shareholder-centric model. However, as the social and environmental costs of business-as-usual become increasingly apparent, and as the feasibility and benefits of alternative models are demonstrated, the pressure for change will grow.
By embedding Social Profit principles into the core of corporate accounting and governance, we can create an economic system that is fundamentally more transparent, accountable, and aligned with the long-term interests of society and the planet.
5.5 Social Profit Innovation and Entrepreneurship Achieving a cooperative economy that maximizes Social Profit will require a sustained wave of innovation and entrepreneurship to develop new technologies, business models, and organizational forms. The Social Profit system will therefore place a high priority on nurturing and supporting social entrepreneurs and innovators.
Some key elements of this innovation ecosystem will include:
* Social Profit Innovation Funds: Public and philanthropic investment vehicles will be created to provide patient, risk-tolerant capital for early-stage social ventures. These funds will prioritize investments that have the potential for high Social Profit impact, even if they may not generate competitive financial returns.
* Cooperative Incubators and Accelerators: A network of incubators and accelerators will be established to provide training, mentorship, and resources to cooperative and social enterprise startups. These programs will help entrepreneurs navigate the unique challenges of launching and scaling businesses with participatory governance and social mission orientation.
* Social Profit Procurement: Government and institutional procurement policies will be reformed to create a stable source of demand for products and services from social enterprises. This could involve setting aside a percentage of contracts for businesses that meet Social Profit criteria or using Social Profit weighting in bid evaluations.
* Open Social Innovation Platforms: Open and collaborative platforms will be created to accelerate social problem-solving and solution-sharing. These could include open-source repositories for social innovations, citizen science projects to crowd-source R&D, and peer-to-peer learning networks for social entrepreneurs.
* Social Profit Education and Training: Educational institutions at all levels will integrate Social Profit principles and skills into their curricula to build a pipeline of future social innovators. This could involve programs such as social entrepreneurship courses, cooperative management training, and experiential learning opportunities with social enterprises.
To incentivize private sector investment in social innovation, a variety of policy tools will be used, such as:
* Social Profit Tax Credits: Companies will receive tax credits for investments in qualified Social Profit ventures and R&D projects, similar to existing credits for scientific research and low-income community development.
* Social Profit Depreciation: Depreciation schedules for Social Profit-related capital investments will be accelerated to encourage the adoption of new technologies and infrastructure that generate positive externalities.
* Social Profit Patent Licensing: The patent system will be reformed to create a "Social Profit patent" designation, which grants licensing priority and fee waivers to social enterprises and nonprofits that use patented technologies for social benefit purposes.
* Social Profit Dividend: Businesses that demonstrate a high and increasing level of Social Profit performance will be eligible for a reduced corporate tax rate and/or a government co-investment dividend.
In addition to these targeted incentives, there will also be broader efforts to create a culture that celebrates and rewards social innovation. This will include high-profile awards and recognition programs for social entrepreneurs, media partnerships to showcase social innovation stories, and public campaigns to promote Social Profit values and role models.
The ultimate goal is to make social innovation and entrepreneurship just as attractive and prestigious as their commercial counterparts. By tapping into the creativity and drive of entrepreneurs and channeling it towards Social Profit ends, we can accelerate the development of the technologies and enterprises needed for a thriving cooperative economy.
Some potential game-changing social innovations that could emerge from this ecosystem include:
* Decentralized renewable energy microgrids that enable energy democracy and decarbonization.
* Cooperative platforms for data and AI that give users control over their digital identity and algorithmic influence.
* Circular economy logistics networks that enable zero-waste, closed-loop resource flows.
* Regenerative agriculture systems that restore biodiversity and soil health while producing healthy food.
* Decentralized manufacturing networks that enable localized, on-demand production of essential goods.
* Participatory urban design and planning platforms that give residents a direct say in shaping their built environment.
* Social-emotional learning technologies that cultivate empathy, collaboration, and conflict resolution skills.
* Preventative and personalized healthcare delivery models that improve outcomes and reduce costs.
As these and other social innovations take hold and scale, they will begin to fundamentally transform the way that value is created and distributed in the economy. By demonstrating the viability and desirability of a cooperative, Social Profit-oriented economic system, they will help to accelerate the broader transition away from shareholder capitalism and towards a more equitable and sustainable future.
Of course, realizing this vision will require more than just technological and business model innovation. It will also require significant policy, regulatory, and cultural changes to create an enabling environment for social entrepreneurship. There will need to be reforms to everything from securities laws and accounting standards to university curricula and media narratives.
Moreover, there will need to be robust safeguards and accountability mechanisms to ensure that social innovations are actually delivering on their intended impacts and not creating unintended consequences. This will require ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment as new social enterprises and technologies are deployed.
However, by building a comprehensive ecosystem to support social innovation and entrepreneurship, we can unleash a powerful force for positive change. Over time, as social enterprises and innovations prove their worth and scale their impact, they will create a virtuous cycle of investment, imitation, and improvement that will drive the transition to a fully cooperative and Social Profit-maximizing economy.
6. Legislative and Regulatory Enablers Realizing the vision of a Social Profit economy will require a profound redesign of the legislative and regulatory architecture that shapes economic activity and corporate behavior. While the specific policies will vary across countries and contexts, there are several key areas where reforms will be essential:
6.1 Corporate Law and Governance Corporate law will need to be fundamentally rewritten to encode Social Profit principles into the DNA of business. Some key reforms could include:
* Redefining the purpose of the corporation to prioritize social and environmental benefit over shareholder returns.
* Requiring all corporations to adopt stakeholder governance structures that give workers, consumers, and communities a voice in decision-making.
* Mandating comprehensive Social Profit accounting and reporting for all businesses above a certain size.
* Creating new corporate forms and legal structures optimized for cooperative ownership and social enterprise.
* Imposing "responsible exit" obligations on business owners to prevent asset-stripping and ensure continuity of social mission.
6.2 Financial Regulation Reforms to financial regulation will be critical to channeling investment towards Social Profit-aligned activities and preventing excessive speculation and risk-taking. Potential measures could include:
* Applying preferential capital and liquidity requirements for loans and investments in Social Profit ventures.
* Taxing financial transactions to curb short-term speculation and encourage long-term, productive investment.
* Requiring institutional investors to disclose and justify the Social Profit impacts of their portfolios.
* Imposing strict limits on the use of exotic financial instruments and off-balance-sheet vehicles.
* Expanding community reinvestment and public banking initiatives to democratize access to credit and capital.
6.3 Tax Policy The tax system will be a key tool for incentivizing Social Profit creation and ensuring equitable distribution of wealth. Some priority reforms could include:
* Replacing corporate income taxes with a Social Profit tax that rewards businesses for positive social and environmental impacts.
* Instituting a progressive wealth tax to reduce concentrations of economic power and fund public goods and services.
* Closing tax loopholes and havens to ensure that all economic actors pay their fair share.
* Offering targeted tax credits and deductions for investments in cooperatives, social enterprises, and green technologies.
* Shifting the tax burden from labor to resource extraction, pollution, and other negative externalities.
6.4 Labor Law Reforms to labor law will be essential to empowering workers and ensuring that the benefits of productivity are widely shared. Key measures could include:
* Guaranteeing the right to unionize and collectively bargain for all workers, including gig and platform workers.
* Mandating worker representation on corporate boards and work councils.
* Establishing sector-wide bargaining to raise standards and reduce inequality across entire industries.
* Implementing a job guarantee that provides living-wage employment for all who want it.
* Expanding protections and benefits for part-time, temporary, and independent workers.
6.5 Antitrust and Competition Policy Strengthening antitrust enforcement and promoting competition will be critical to preventing monopoly power and ensuring dynamic and responsive markets. Priority reforms could include:
* Adopting a broader definition of market power that considers impacts on workers, suppliers, and communities, not just consumer prices.
* Blocking mergers and breaking up firms that have acquired excessive market share and political influence.
* Banning predatory pricing and other anti-competitive practices that squeeze out small businesses and cooperatives.
* Requiring dominant platforms to provide open and non-discriminatory access to their data and infrastructure.
* Promoting interoperability and data portability standards to reduce switching costs and lock-in effects.
6.6 Innovation and Intellectual Property Reforms to intellectual property regimes and innovation policies will be needed to accelerate the development and diffusion of Social Profit-aligned technologies. Potential measures could include:
* Expanding funding for public and cooperative research and development in areas of high social need.
* Reforming patent and copyright laws to strike a better balance between innovation incentives and knowledge sharing.
* Creating a "Social Profit patent pool" that allows open licensing of key technologies for social enterprise and nonprofit use.
* Mandating open access publication and data sharing for all publicly funded research.
* Providing targeted support for technology transfer and commercialization of Social Profit innovations.
Implementing these kinds of systemic legislative and regulatory reforms will undoubtedly be a complex and contested process. There will be powerful vested interests that will resist and seek to block progress at every turn.
However, by building broad-based and sustained political pressure for change, it is possible to create a new policy landscape that better aligns economic incentives with social and ecological imperatives. This will require a multi-pronged approach that combines grassroots organizing, electoral advocacy, strategic litigation, and public narrative change.
Moreover, it will be important to seize near-term policy windows when they arise, while also laying the groundwork for more transformative reforms over the longer term. By making incremental progress and demonstrating the positive impacts of Social Profit policies, it will be possible to build momentum and expand the boundaries of political possibility.
Ultimately, the goal is to create a virtuous cycle of policy change and economic transformation, in which each successive reform creates more space and demand for the next. As Social Profit enterprises and institutions gain strength and influence, they will be able to exert greater political pressure for supportive policies, which will in turn enable them to grow and thrive even further.
Of course, legislative and regulatory reforms are not a panacea, and they will need to be complemented by many other strategies and interventions. However, they are a critical enabler for the transition to a cooperative and socially-responsible economy. By reshaping the "rules of the game," we can create a more level playing field for Social Profit actors and activities, and accelerate the shift away from extractive and exploitative economic models.
In the end, the power to transform the economy and build a more just and sustainable future lies not just in the halls of government, but in the collective action of workers, consumers, and communities everywhere. By organizing and advocating for change on multiple fronts, we can create the conditions for a truly cooperative and inclusive economy to emerge and flourish.
7. Conclusion and Next Steps The vision laid out in this document is ambitious and far-reaching. It proposes a fundamental redesign of our economic system to prioritize social and ecological well-being over private profit. It envisions a future where cooperative and commons-based models of production and distribution are the norm, where economic power is widely dispersed and democratically accountable, and where the creation of Social Profit is the primary measure of success.
Realizing this vision will require a sustained, multi-generational effort to transform deeply entrenched institutions, norms, and power structures. It will require creativity, experimentation, and adaptation as we navigate uncharted territory and confront unexpected challenges. And it will require building new forms of solidarity, cooperation, and collective action to overcome the resistance of those who benefit from the status quo.
However, as daunting as this transformation may seem, it is also a matter of necessity. The current economic system is driving us towards ecological collapse, social breakdown, and political instability. It is failing to meet the needs and aspirations of the vast majority of people around the world. Continuing on the same path is simply not an option.
Fortunately, there are already countless initiatives and movements around the world that are pointing the way towards a cooperative and Social Profit-oriented economy. From worker-owned cooperatives and community land trusts to open-source software and participatory budgeting, people are experimenting with new ways of organizing economic activity that prioritize human and ecological flourishing.
The task now is to connect and scale up these scattered experiments into a coherent and compelling alternative to the dominant system. This will require:
* Further developing and refining the concepts and models outlined in this document, through both theoretical analysis and practical application.
* Building alliances and coalitions among the diverse actors and movements working towards economic transformation, to develop shared visions and strategies for change.
* Advocating for supportive public policies and investments at all levels of government, to create an enabling environment for cooperative and Social Profit-oriented economic activity.
* Educating and mobilizing the broader public around the need for systemic economic change, and the viability and desirability of a cooperative and socially-responsible alternative.
* Documenting and disseminating successful examples and case studies of Social Profit economic practices, to inspire replication and adaptation in diverse contexts.
None of this will be easy, and there will undoubtedly be setbacks and failures along the way. However, the potential rewards are immense. By building a more cooperative and socially-responsive economic system, we can create a world of shared prosperity, empowered communities, and regenerative ecological relationships. We can unleash the full creative potential of humanity to solve our most pressing challenges and create a more beautiful and fulfilling future for all.
The journey towards this future starts with each of us taking responsibility for the economic systems and relationships we participate in every day. It starts with questioning the dominant narratives and assumptions about what is possible and desirable. And it starts with experimenting and organizing to build the world we want to see.
So let us begin.
